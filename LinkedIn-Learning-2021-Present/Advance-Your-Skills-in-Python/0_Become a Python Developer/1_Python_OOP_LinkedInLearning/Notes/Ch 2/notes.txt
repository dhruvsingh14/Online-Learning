Ch 2: Inheritance

(i) inheritance: allows subclass to inherit from base class

(ii) multiple inheritance: unique to python, unlike other programming languages
			allows classes to inherit from multiple base classes

			mixup can be inefficient to the program while executing, used sparingly

(iii) method resolution order: to look up in class, can be checked using .__mro__

(iv) composition: more like a relationship. not wholly unlike inheritance, some overlap is possible

(v) abstract class: blueprint for other classes

(vi) interface: also acts as a blueprint for designing classes, but it differs from abstract class
