* What is the command-line

	data analysis, storage etc

(ii) CLI: text based, can see input and output text on the screen

(iii) Can interact with files

(iv) Bash: bourne again shell used to interact with system

(v) CLI used in terminal. Common to have multiple terminals open. 

(vi) People use terminal and shell interchangeably, even though they're

	slightly different. No harm in doing so however.

* Understand how command are structured: 

(i) Some common concepts

(ii) Structure: command option(s) argument(s)

(iii) Without commands, shell wont know what to do

(iv) efficiency vs. understandability

(v) many options start with a dash or minus sign. 

	can even combine options with one dash, 

		with no space in between, order doesn't matter

	other options that have two dashes cannot be combined

* Write commands in a shell at the prompt: 

(i) Spelling counts when working with the command line

(iii) Eg 'man ls' pulls up the technical documentation for ls

(iv) h, f, b, to navigate documentation. cursor tells what line we're at

(v) some commands have the ' --help' option as mini documentation, eg: "ls --help"
