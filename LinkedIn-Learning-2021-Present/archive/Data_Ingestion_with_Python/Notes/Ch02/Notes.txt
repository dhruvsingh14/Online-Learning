Ch02: Reading Files

* CSV

(i) pros: easy to export/import from excel

(ii) cons: everything is a string, no standard, hard to work with unicode

(iii) CSV can be compressed alot

(iv) dictionary reader is nice, consumes little, doesn't blow up memory

(v) convert to dictionary, explicility specify type while reading in

(vi) the other way to do this is using pandas

(vii) .csv.bz2 is a compressed file format. fairl common with csv.

(viii) pandas does a great job of guessing types, but not perfect, esp. w/ date columns

(ix) the way to correct for this is to specify parse_dates when calling read_csv

(x) lastly, can specify chunksize option in read_csv to get a text type sub dataframe

* Working in XML

(i) DOM: loading everything into memory, vs. SAX: iterative, can be done in pieces

(ii) ElemenTree, and lxml are two libraries

(iii) since everything in xml is text, we need to convert manually
