### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

No challenges as such.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

Successful outcomes peak in May. Converge in December.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Percentage Successful and Percentage Failed are countercyclical.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

It's restricted to certain time period. At other times, macroeconomic conditions might be different, 

and thus affect the sorts of projects attracting funding.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

Maybe a heatmap, or correlation between funding and outcomes.
